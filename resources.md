## Resources for Learning PHP
There isn't a specific book or set of online tutorials that the course is based on, but there are loads of useful PHP resources out on the web and available via the University's library. Often they will provide a bit more detail that is provided on this course and they will also explain web programming concepts in different ways which can be useful if things don't immediately make sense to you. So you should make the effort to use resources from outside this module.

There is a word of warning before jumping into using specific book or online tutorial. PHP is a language that has changed quite a lot in recent years. Be wary of books or tutorials that are older than 5 years old. Specifically you should check they are focused on PHP 7, and if working with databases they should ideally use the PDO database extension.  

Have a look under 'Key Items' and then 'Reading List' for a list of possible resources that might be useful for learning PHP.

Explore some of these resources and try and find ones that you think will be useful to you as you study this module.
